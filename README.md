# Public_projects
This is my public projects that I have created 

1. GUI login screen
   The GUI login screen I made during a class a long time ago. On start, it makes a 400 by 300 pixel area and acts as the GUI borders. It takes in a user name and password and then asks for a unique passpharse. Once the password is verified allows the user to login. For a more detailed descriptin please refer to passwordCatcher.java.
